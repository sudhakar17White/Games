            The players may count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!"), 
            either raising one hand in a fist and     
            swinging it down with each syllable or holding it behind their back.
            They then "throw" or "shoot" by extending it towards their opponent.
            Variations include a version where players throw immediately on the 
            third count (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!"), or a version 
            where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".
